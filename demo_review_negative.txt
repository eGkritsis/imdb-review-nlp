Well... at least it made me appreciate the Sam Raimi movies a bit more. Every character from past movies is done badly (in the case of the Raimi characters) or even worse (since The Amazing Spider-Man was terrible to begin with). They try to give Hollands Spider-Man a bit more development and growth but too little, too late. Utter garbage. Typical of Hollywood and the MCU.
